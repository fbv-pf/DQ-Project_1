This way, a larger user base can be achieved, and more add revenue will follow.\n",

Though this strategy can work, it is a risky one, since a lot more resources are being put into a product that may not be popular. The strategy we defined above carries the risk of offering an underwelming app with lacking features, but at the same time only a good core idea should be followed. Such ideas can be explored easily since the overhead for a deployable product is low.\n",
