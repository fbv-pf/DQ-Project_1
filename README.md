# DQ-Project_1
This repository contains my solution to Project 1 in Dataquest's Data Science certification.

## What is this project and its goal?
This project is about simulating the role of a data analyst working at a company that develops apps for Android and iOS systems. The business model here is one of free apps with revenue coming in through in-app ads.

We are in charge of using data from our portfolio of apps to help the app developers understand what type of apps bring about the most users.

This is valuable since more users means more ad revenue.

## What have I learned so far?
- Open a data set, explore its structure, identify variables of interest for the task at hand.
- Analyze the data set, check for duplicate values or entries.
- Create a routine that cleans the data set of duplicate values and entries.
