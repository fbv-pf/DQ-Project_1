# DQ-Project_1
This repository contains my solution to Project 1 in Dataquest's Data Science certification.

## What is this project and its goal?
This project is about simulating the role of a data analyst working at a company that develops apps for Android and iOS systems. The business model here is one of free apps with revenue coming in through in-app ads.

We are in charge of using data from our portfolio of apps to help the app developers understand what type of apps bring about the most users.

This is valuable since more users means more ad revenue.

## Note

This is my first guided project solution. The techniques used here are very basic, and I took the project as far as the guidelines asked me to go.

## What have I learned so far?
- Open a data set, explore its structure, identify variables of interest for the task at hand.
- Prepare the data set, check for duplicate values or entries, and abide other criteria.
- Create a routine that cleans the data set of duplicate values and entries.
- Further data filtering, in this case removing non-English apps from the data set, plus removing data that does not serve our objectives (non-free apps).
- Learned how to do a (simple) analysis of the data, drawing valuable information from it.
- Also learned how to use Jupyter notebooks, the system and its notation.
- It was fun!
